This is a repository to flesh out my python knowledge somemore. Learing how to connect APIs and have a bot respond to user input and so much more. This is a journey 
im taking to better myself in programming and become used to Git and Github as a whole. The first of many projects hopefully to showcase my talent and the energy i plan to bring 
to any future endevours
